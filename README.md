# DailyDos

## Description
This is a simple command-line to-do list application implemented in Python. Users can add, remove, and view tasks, as well as save and load tasks to/from a text file.

## Features
- Add tasks: Users can add tasks to their to-do list.
- Remove tasks: Users can remove tasks from their to-do list.
- View tasks: Users can view the current list of tasks.
- Save tasks: Tasks are persisted to a text file so they are not lost when the program is closed.
- Load tasks: Previously saved tasks are loaded when the program starts.

## Getting Started
To run the To-Do List Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the command `python todo_app.py` to start the application.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the application.

## Usage
- Add Task: Enter a task description when prompted.
- Remove Task: Enter the index of the task to remove when prompted.
- View Tasks: Choose the "View tasks" option to see the current list of tasks.
- Quit: Choose the "Quit" option to exit the application.

## What I Learned
- Implementing basic data manipulation in Python.
- Handling user input and displaying output in a command-line interface.
- Using file I/O to save and load data to/from a text file.
- Structuring a simple command-line application with multiple functionalities.
- Applying error handling to handle invalid user input gracefully.
